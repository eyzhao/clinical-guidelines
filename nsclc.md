# NSCLC

Modifications to staging were made for AJCC-8 <cite name='Goldstraw2016'>Goldstraw et al. 2016</cite>.

## Early Resectable

Definitive management of early resectable NSCLC (Stage I-II) is by surgical resection. Initial assessment should focus on

- Suitability of patient for OR
  - Lung function (FEV1, DLCO) - consider exercise testing.
  - Comorbidities - consider pre-operative medical consult
    - Cardiac risk factors
  - Anesthesia assessment

> Surgical candidates should be referred for urgent surgical consultation.

### Stage I

Surgical consultation is necessary to determine optimal resection method


<a name='node_stage1_lobectomy'></a>
#### Lobectomy
Lobectomy is the standard of care for stage I NSCLC. 


<a name='node_stage1_wedge'></a>
#### Limited Resection
Limited (segment/wedge) resection: an option for carefully selected patients with solitary lesions and limited lung function. However, compared to lobectomy: 75% &uarr; local recurrence, 30% &uarr; overall death rate, 50% &uarr; cancer death rate <cite name='Ginsberg1995'>Ginsberg et al. 1995</cite>.


#### Outcomes and Prognosis

| Stage | 5-yr survival (c stage) | 5-yr survival (p stage) |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| IA1   | 92%                     | 90%                     |
| IA2   | 83%                     | 85%                     |
| IA3   | 77%                     | 80%                     |
| IB    | 68%                     | 73%                     |

5-year recurrence rate after resection is 20-30% <multicite><cite name='Goodgame2009'>Goodgame et al. 2009</cite></multicite>.

Risk factors for recurrence after surgery: CEA, T-stage, lymphatic/vascular invasion, pleural invasion <cite name='Kawachi2009'>Kawachi et al. 2009</cite>.

Earlier recurrence is a very poor prognostic factor, decreasing 5-year survival from 50-60% (late recurrence) to < 10-20% (early recurrence) <cite name='Kawachi2009'>Kawachi et al. 2009</cite>. Advanced age is not a risk factor for recurrence <cite name='Goodgame2009'>Goodgame et al. 2009</cite>.

### Stage II

| Stage | 5-yr survival (c stage) | 5-yr survival (p stage) |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| IIA   |  60%                    | 65%                     |
| IIB   |  53%                    | 56%                     |



## Locally Advanced

## Resected

Pathologic upstaging is seen in 30% of patients ([Lopez-Encuentra 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003497504012330?via%3Dihub), [Schuchert 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20813313/)).
